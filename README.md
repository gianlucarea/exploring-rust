# Rust Learning and Projects

Welcome to my Rust repository! This repo is structured into two main sections: **Learning** and **Projects**. The **Learning** section contains my progress through Rust tutorials and courses, while the **Projects** section includes small applications I built to practice Rust.

## Learning Section

### Rust Book
This folder contains code examples and exercises from *[The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)*, commonly referred to as "The Rust Book." It serves as an official and comprehensive guide to learning Rust.

### Ultimate Rust Course
This section includes my exercises and implementations from Ultimate Rust course. You can find the course [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-rust-crash-course/).

## Projects Section

### To-Do App
A simple command-line to-do application that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed.

### Calculator
A basic calculator built in Rust, supporting fundamental arithmetic operations.
